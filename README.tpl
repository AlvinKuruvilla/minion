# Live-coding

The crate is under development as part of a live-coding stream series intended
for users who are already somewhat familiar with Rust, and who want to see
something larger and more involved be built.

You can find the recordings of past sessions in [this YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFgY2faCIYjJZv_RluGkTlKt).
This crate was made in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS14JIRZTBw). To get updates about
future streams, follow me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jonhoo) or

# Thank you

For each of the projects I build, I like to thank the people who are willing
and able to take the extra step of supporting me in making these videos on
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jonhoo) or
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/jonhoo/). You have my most sincere gratitude,
and I'm so excited that you find what I do interesting enough that you're
willing to give a stranger money to do something they love!
